# Professional Porfolio

***

During this challenge, I was given the task to create a porfolio showing off my previous work, a section about me and links where employers can contact me.

## Work Completed

* Created a header with a hover selector to change the color of text when hovered over
* Added subtitles on images with background and font stylying
* Placed borders on each heading on the right side, where the main code was written
* Added opacity(to look faded until hovered) and borders to each of the images in the work area
